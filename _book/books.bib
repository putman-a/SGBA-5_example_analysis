  abstract = {Background: A hurdle to incorporating Sex- and Gender-Based Analysis is a lack of easily implemented measurement tools. To address this, we created the Sex- and Gender-Based Analysis Tool -- 5 item [SGBA-5]. Objectives: Assess the validity and reliability of the SGBA-5 for health research where sex or gender are not primary variables. Methods: A Delphi consensus study was conducted with Canadian researchers [n=14]. A 2-arm [students, n=89; older adults, n = 71] test-retest study was then conducted. Results: Agreement was reached for the sex item [93\%] and non-agreement for gendered aspect of health items [identity: 64\%, expression: 64\%, roles: 50\%, relations: 57\%]. The test-retest study found all items reliable on both arms [sex: {$\kappa$} = 1.00, gendered: ICC(A,1) {$>$} .865]. Conclusion: The novel SGBA-5 demonstrated reliability for all items and validity of the sex item; the gendered aspects of health items may be valid. Future research will further assess the SGBA-5.},
