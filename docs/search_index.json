[["continuous.html", "Chapter 4 SGBA of a Continuous Variable 4.1 Biological Sex", " Chapter 4 SGBA of a Continuous Variable Note 1: for conciseness, the following examples will only show results for two of the four gendered aspects of health items from the SGBA-5 (gender identity, and gender roles) Note 2: for each of the following sections, an example outcome variable that demonstrates a relationship between that variable and the SGBA-5 item being assessed - the interaction example - and an example that does not demonstrate a relationship between itself and the SGBA-5 item - the no interaction example - are shown. 4.1 Biological Sex A good idea is to start by visualizing the continuous variable’s distribution disaggregated by sex like the density plot in Figure 4.1. Then calculate disaggregated summary statistics for the continuous variable disaggregated by sex (Tables 4.1 and 4.2), and conduct a statistical test of difference in means (Welch’s t-test for this example). 4.1.1 Density Plots Figure 4.1: Density Plot of Continuous Variable by Biological Sex Examples Interpretation: From the above density plots (Figure 4.1) we can see a distinct overlap in the no interaction example with suggests that in that example’s sample does not have a meaningful difference in the continuous outcome by sex. Conversely, the interaction example density plot has two distinct peaks which suggests that its sample’s continuous outcome scores are associated with a participant’s sex. 4.1.2 Summary Statistics Table 4.1: Interation example summary statisitics: Continuous outcome and biological sex biological sex n mean continuous SD continuous median continuous IQR continuous Female 14 3.5 1.94 4 2 Male 16 11.3 2.95 11 2 Table 4.2: No interation example summary statisitics: Continuous outcome and biological sex biological sex n mean continuous SD continuous median continuous IQR continuous Female 14 9.0 1.84 9 2 Male 16 10.8 3.47 11 3 Interpretation: As with the density plots, we see that the standard deviations of the continuous variable for both males and females overlap in the no interaction example (Table 4.1) - indicating a lack of significant difference by sex. The standard deviations of the continuous variable for both males and females do not overlap in the interaction example (Table 4.2) - indicating a potential association between that continuous outcome variable and sex. 4.1.3 Statistical Test No interaction: Welch’s t-test Table 4.3: Statistical test of difference: Continuous outcome and biological sex. Example Test T-score 95% CI df p-value Interaction Welch’s t-test -8.73 (-9.72, -6.02) 26.1 0.000 No interaction Welch’s t-test -1.80 (-3.85, 0.26) 23.4 0.084 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
