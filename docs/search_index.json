The examples do not cover all potential analyses that could be done using the SGBA-5 but does provide a solid foundation from which researchers can select from and build upon. 1.1 Further Resources More information on the SGBA-5, instructions for its use, and rationale for are included in the SGBA-5’s documentation [SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL URL]. Initial reliability and validity testing of the SGBA-5 are reported in the paper by Putman, Cole, &amp; Dogra [DOI] and in A Putman’s thesis work.

"],["descriptive-analysis.html", "Chapter 3 Descriptive Analysis 3.1 Visualize Distribution of SGBA-5 Responses 3.2 Descriptive Table of SGBA-5 Responses", " Chapter 3 Descriptive Analysis Note: for conciseness, the following examples will only show results for two of the four gendered aspects of health items from the SGBA-5 (gender identity, and gender roles) 3.1 Visualize Distribution of SGBA-5 Responses 3.1.1 Biological Sex Item In plot 3.1 we see that there are more participants who report their biological sex as assigned as female at birth (n=18) than males (n=12). Figure 3.1: Barplot of Biological Sex Responses 3.1.2 Gendered Aspect of Health Items Looking at the density plots for gender identity and gender role (figure 3.2), we see that while both variables are bimodal, the gender identity responses is more strongly bimodal with one peak closer to the feminine side of the feminine-masculine continuum and one peak closer to masculine end of that continuum. Further, we can also see that in general, participants reported their gender identity and roles as being more feminine, again with the gender identity responses showing this trend more strongly than the gender role responses. Figure 3.2: Density plots of Gender Identity and Roles Presently, there is no clear consensus on how to present descriptive statistics of bimodal variables in health research. Reporting the mean(sd) or median(IQR) of a variable does not clearly communicate that there is more than one peak in a bimodal variable’s distribution. When taken alongside the SGBA-5’s assumption that the feminine-masculine continuum doesn’t have a true 0 value, it is our suggestion that: If researchers decide to report a descriptive statistic for a bimodally distributed variable, they should report a nominal description of the variable’s distriubtion skew. For example, if a gendered aspect of health item from the SGBA-5 demonstrates a bimodal distribution, the variable’s skew can be described along the feminine-masculine continuum instead of reporting the numerical average alone. To be able to describe the skew of one of the gender variables, the authors suggest calculating the variable’s mean score along the feminine-masculine continuum and then reporting the skew using the suggested nominal classification guide seen in Table 3.1. Please note that these suggested classification guidelines are arbitrary and may not be appropriate in all circumstances. Table 3.1: Potential Interpretation of Sample Means for Gendered Aspect of Health Items. Mean Interpretation &gt;70 “Skews masculine” 55 to 70 “More masculine than feminine” 45 to 55 “Not strongly skewed” 30 to 45 “More feminine than masculine” &lt;30 “Skews feminine” Note: This table assumes you have recorded the gendered aspects of health items as 0 being the most feminine score and 100 being the most masculine score. For the simulated dataset represented in the density plots above, the mean score for the gender identity item was 50.2 and 46.8 for the gender role item. This means that when reporting descriptive statistics on the simulated sample we could report that: “The simulated sample was not strongly skewed on a feminine to masculine continuum for either the gender identity or gender role measures from the SGBA-5”. 3.2 Descriptive Table of SGBA-5 Responses Taking all these together, an example of a sample characteristics table of the SGBA-5 items in the simulated dataset could be presented as has been displayed in Table 3.2 Table 3.2: Simulated sample characteristics.

Then calculate disaggregated summary statistics for the continuous variable disaggregated by sex (Tables 4.1 and 4.2), and conduct a statistical test of difference in means (Welch’s t-test for this example). 4.1.1 Density Plots by Biological Sex Figure 4.1: Density Plot of Continuous Variable by Biological Sex Examples Interpretation: From the above density plots (Figure 4.1) we can see a distinct overlap in the no interaction example which suggests that in that example’s sample does not have a meaningful difference in the continuous outcome by sex. Conversely, the interaction example density plot has two distinct peaks which suggests that its sample’s continuous outcome scores are associated with a participant’s sex. 4.1.2 Summary Statistics by Biological Sex Table 4.1: Interation example summary statisitics: Continuous outcome and biological sex biological sex n mean continuous SD continuous median continuous IQR continuous Female 14 3.5 1.94 4 2 Male 16 11.3 2.95 11 2 Table 4.2: No interation example summary statisitics: Continuous outcome and biological sex biological sex n mean continuous SD continuous median continuous IQR continuous Female 14 9.0 1.84 9 2 Male 16 10.8 3.47 11 3 Interpretation: As with the density plots, we see that the standard deviations of the continuous variable for both males and females overlap in the no interaction example (Table 4.1) - indicating a lack of significant difference by sex. The standard deviations of the continuous variable for both males and females do not overlap in the interaction example (Table 4.2) - indicating a potential association between that continuous outcome variable and sex. 4.1.3 Statistical Testing of Biological Sex: t-test Next we will test the null hypothesis that biological sex does not have an impact on the continuous outcome variable being evaluated. Both the interaction example and no interaction example will be tested using a Welch’s t-test at an alpha of .05. Note: Using a Welch’s t-test to test for statistically significant difference in these examples is a way, but by no means the only way in which this could be tested. Table 4.3: Statistical test of difference: Continuous outcome and biological sex. Example Test T-score 95% CI df p-value Interaction Welch’s t-test -8.73 (-9.72, -6.02) 26.1 0.000 No interaction Welch’s t-test -1.80 (-3.85, 0.26) 23.4 0.084 Interpretation: Similarly to the descriptive table and density plots, we see that the no interaction example (Table 4.3) does not show a significant difference by sex (T=-1.80, 95%CI=(-3.85,0.26), df=23.4, p-value&gt;0.08). The interaction example (Table 4.3) shows a potential association between that continuous outcome variable and sex (T=-8.73, 95%CI=(-9.82,-6.02), df=23.4, p-value&lt;0.001), meriting further research into this potential interaction. This means that when reporting whether there was an association found between a continuous outcome and biological sex in the no interaction sample we can report that: “The no interaction sample did not show evidence that biological sex was associated with the continuous outcome in this study”. Whereas the interaction sample, which did find a potential association, could report: “The interaction sample found statistically significant evidence that biological sex was associated with the continuous outcome in this study”. 4.1.4 Biological Sex: Interpretation Reporting Template Below are example templates for reporting whether an outcome variable is associated with biological sex as categorized by the SGBA-5. Replace the words in the square brackets to complete. If an association was found: In this study’s sample we found that a person’s self-reported biological sex at birth had a statistically significant association with [continuous variable name]. More detailed investigation of this relationship is required to directly interpret the potential effects this interaction. If an association was not found: In this study’s sample we found that a person’s self-reported biological sex at birth did not show a statistically significant association with [continuous variable name]. 4.2 Gendered Aspects of Health: Gender Identity In this section we will analyze the gendered aspects of health results from the SGBA-5 with a continuous variable of interest. First we will generate scatter (Figure 4.2 ) and 2D-density plots (Figure 4.3) of the continuous variable by the feminine-masculine continuum used in the SGBA-5. Then we shall calculate a Pearson correlation coefficient between each gendered aspect of health item and the continuous variable. 4.2.1 Scatter &amp; 2-D Density Plots by Gender Identity Figure 4.2: Scatter Plot of Continuous Variable by Gender Identity Figure 4.3: 2D Density Plots of Continuous Variable by Gender Identity Interpretation: From the above scatter and 2-D density plots (Figures 4.2 and 4.3) we can see no clear pattern difference in the continuous outcome value across the feminine-masculine continuum in the no interaction example (i.e., the continuous outcome values of participants who are closer to the feminine end of the continuum are not noticeably different than participants who are not closer to the feminine end of the continuum). This suggests that the no interaction example does not show a meaningful difference in the continuous outcome by gender identity within this sample. Conversely, the interaction example scatter and 2-D density plots show two distinct clusters with the cluster closer to the feminine end of the continuum having higher continuous outcome values than the cluster closer to the masculine end of the continuum. This suggests that the interaction example sample’s continuous outcome scores are associated with participants’ self-reported place on the SGBA-5’s feminine-masculine gender identity continuum. 4.2.2 Summary Statistics by Gender Identity We do not recommend creating disaggregated summary statistics by any of the gendered aspects of health items from the SGBA-5. Analysis for effects associated with these variables can be conducted visually using plots (section 4.2.1) or through statistical testing (section 4.2.3). 4.2.3 Statistical Testing of Gender Identity: Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (r) Next we will test the null hypothesis that a participant’s self-reported gender identity on a feminine-masculine continuum does not have an impact on the continuous outcome variable being evaluated. Both the interaction example and no interaction example will be tested by calculating Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient and describing that coefficient’s strength and direction (but not the exact coefficient value) as well as test for statistical significance of the correlation at an alpha of .05. To be able to describe the strength of correlation between a continuous outcome and one of the gendered aspect of health variables, the authors suggest using a nominal classification of correlation strength. Using a nominal classification to interpret the strength of a correlation is inherently somewhat arbitrary, however this trade-off can reduce potential misinterpretation that reporting a numerical coefficient value could cause. There maybe context- or discipline-specific guidelines for the interpretation of correlation strength which apply to your analysis. For the examples presented here, we will use the guidelines recommended in Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioural Sciences (2013) by Jacob Cohen, which can be seen in Table 4.4. Please note that these suggested classification guidelines are arbitrary and may not be appropriate in all circumstances. Table 4.4: Nominal Interpretations of Correlation Strength. Strength of Correlation Positive Correlation Coefficient (r) Negative Correlation Coefficient (r) None 0.0 to 0.1 0.0 to -0.1 Small 0.1 to 0.3 -0.1 to -0.3 Medium 0.3 to 0.5 -0.3 to -0.5 Large 0.5 to 1.0 -0.5 to -1.0 Note: Adapted from Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioural Sciences (2013) by Jacob Cohen Note: Using Pearson’s correlation coefficient to test for statistically significant difference in these examples is a way, but by no means the only way in which this could be tested. Table 4.5: Statistical test of difference: Continuous outcome and Gender Idenity Item from the SGBA-5. Example Correlation Type r 95% CI df Significance Test T-score p-value Interaction Pearson’s r -0.80 (-0.9, -0.61) 28 t-test -6.96 0.000 No interaction Pearson’s r 0.02 (-0.34, 0.38) 28 t-test 0.10 0.084 Interpretation: The correlation coefficient we see for the no interaction example (Table 4.5) was 0.02. Using the classification criteria outlined in Table 4.4, we see that the strength of correlation is “none”. Thus, we can report that “The no interaction sample did not show evidence of correlation between the gender identity item and the continuous outcome”. Similarly, we see that the no interaction example’s correlation does not meet the statistical significance threshold of 0.05 from the null hypothesis (T=0.10, df=28, p-value&gt;0.08).
