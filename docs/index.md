# About

The example analyses presented in this document are a demonstration of how sex-and gender-based analysis (SGBA) can be conducted using results from the Sex- and Gender-Based Analysis Tool – 5 item (SGBA-5) by Putman and Dogra [DOI].The examples in this document demonstrate a [descriptive analysis](#descriptive-analysis) of simulated SGBA-5 responses and SGBA of simulated health outcomes that are [continuous](#continuous), ordered (Likert scale), or categorical (binary) to examine potential interactions with the biological sex item and two of the gendered aspects of health items.

The examples do not cover all potential analyses that could be done using the SGBA-5 but does provide a solid foundation from which researchers can select from and build upon.

More information on the SGBA-5, instructions for its use, and rationale for are included in the SGBA-5’s documentation [SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL URL]. Initial reliability and validity testing of the SGBA-5 are reported in the paper by Putman, Cole, & Dogra [DOI] and in A Putman's [thesis work](https://ontariotechu.scholaris.ca/items/fddf2667-8cd6-429d-85bd-74b0076ab561).
