# About

The following example analysis demonstrates a way in which sex-and gender-based analysis (SGBA) can be conducted using results from the Sex- and Gender-Based Analysis Tool – 5 item (SGBA-5) by Putman and Dogra which can be downloaded [here](https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Sex-_and_gender-based_analysis_tool_5-item_v1_0_/29090615?file=54611480).The SGBA-5 is free to use and is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

The examples shown in the following sections cover a [descriptive analysis](#descriptive-analysis) of simulated SGBA-5 responses (e.g., what SGBA-5 results may look like in a Table 1). Then an approach is demonstrated where a [continuous](#continuous) variable (i.e., the primary outcome of a study) is assessed by looking for potential interactions between that continuous variable and the biological sex item or the gendered aspects of health items from the SGBA-5. The examples provided do not cover all potential analyses that could be done using the SGBA-5 but do provide a solid foundation from which researchers can select from and build upon.

The R code to reproduce the plots and statistical tests used in the examples is included in the [Appendix](#appendix).

## Further Resources

More information on the SGBA-5, instructions for its use, and rationale for are included in the SGBA-5’s [documentation](https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Sex-_and_gender-based_analysis_tool_5-item_v1_0_/29090615?file=54611480). Initial reliability and validity testing of the SGBA-5 are reported in the paper by Putman, Cole, & Dogra (2025) in [PLOS ONE](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0323834) and in A Putman's [thesis work](https://ontariotechu.scholaris.ca/items/fddf2667-8cd6-429d-85bd-74b0076ab561).
