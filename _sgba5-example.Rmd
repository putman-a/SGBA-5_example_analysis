# About

The example analyses presented in this document are a demonstration of how sex-and gender-based analysis (SGBA) can be conducted using results from the Sex- and Gender-Based Analysis Tool – 5 item (SGBA-5) by Putman and Dogra [DOI].The examples in this document demonstrate a [descriptive analysis](#descriptive-analysis) of simulated SGBA-5 responses and SGBA of simulated health outcomes that are [continuous](#continuous), ordered (Likert scale), or categorical (binary) to examine potential interactions with the biological sex item and two of the gendered aspects of health items.

The examples do not cover all potential analyses that could be done using the SGBA-5 but does provide a solid foundation from which researchers can select from and build upon.

## Further Resources

More information on the SGBA-5, instructions for its use, and rationale for are included in the SGBA-5’s documentation [SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL URL]. Initial reliability and validity testing of the SGBA-5 are reported in the paper by Putman, Cole, & Dogra [DOI] and in A Putman's [thesis work](https://ontariotechu.scholaris.ca/items/fddf2667-8cd6-429d-85bd-74b0076ab561).

# Data Structure {#data-structure}

## Collected SGBA-5 Responses

After collecting responses from the SGBA-5 you will have a dataset that looks something like this:




Table: (\#tab:01-example-table)Example Data Structure

| pt_id|sex    | gen_id| gen_exp| gen_role| gen_rel|
|-----:|:------|------:|-------:|--------:|-------:|
|     1|Female |     48|      99|       70|      25|
|     2|Male   |    100|      17|       99|       2|
|     3|Female |     64|      48|       88|      40|
|     4|Female |     24|      46|       36|      88|
|     5|Male   |     73|      23|       19|      26|

__Note:__
The values in this table are placeholders for the example, not real data

Where:

`pt_id` is the participant identifier.  

`sex` is the SGBA-5 categorical Biological Sex item.  

  - response options of "male", "female", and "intersex".  

`gen_id` is the SGBA-5 Gender Identity gendered aspect of health item.  

  - Responses are recorded as ordinal values between 0 to 100 on a feminine to masculine scale (measured in mm if completed on paper).  

`gen_exp` is the SGBA-5 Gender Expression gendered aspect of health item.  

  - Responses are recorded as ordinal values between 0 to 100 on a feminine to masculine scale (measured in mm if completed on paper).  

`gen_role` is the SGBA-5 Gender Role gendered aspect of health item.  

  - Responses are recorded as ordinal values between 0 to 100 on a feminine to masculine scale (measured in mm if completed on paper).  

`gen_rel` is the SGBA-5 Gender Relations gendered aspect of health item.  

  - Responses are recorded as ordinal values between 0 to 100 on a feminine to masculine scale (measured in mm if completed on paper).


## Simulated Data

This example analysis uses simulated data, if you wish to replicate the simulate data the code to do so is included in the [Appendix](#appendix) or can be downloaded from this example's [github page](https://github.com/putman-a/SGBA-5_example_analysis/%s).

# Descriptive Analysis {#descriptive-analysis}



> *Note: for conciseness, the following examples will only show results for two of the four gendered aspects of health items from the SGBA-5 (gender identity, and gender roles)*


## Visualize Distribution of SGBA-5 Responses

### Biological Sex Item

In plot \@ref(fig:02-univar-sex-plot) we see that there are more participants who report their **biological sex** as assigned as female at birth (n=18) than males (n=12). 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="02-descriptive-analysis_files/figure-html/02-univar-sex-plot-1.png" alt="Barplot of Biological Sex Responses" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:02-univar-sex-plot)Barplot of Biological Sex Responses</p>
</div>

### Gendered Aspect of Health Items

Looking at the density plots for **gender identity** and **gender role** (figure \@ref(fig:02-univar-gi-plot)), we see that while both variables are bimodal, the **gender identity** responses is more strongly bimodal with one peak closer to the feminine side of the feminine-masculine continuum and one peak closer to masculine end of that continuum. Further, we can also see that in general, participants reported their **gender identity** and **roles** as being more feminine, again with the **gender identity** responses showing this trend more strongly than the **gender role** responses.  

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="02-descriptive-analysis_files/figure-html/02-univar-gi-plot-1.png" alt="Density plots of Gender Identity and Roles" width="50%" /><img src="02-descriptive-analysis_files/figure-html/02-univar-gi-plot-2.png" alt="Density plots of Gender Identity and Roles" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:02-univar-gi-plot)Density plots of Gender Identity and Roles</p>
</div>

Presently, there is _<span style="color:red">no clear consensus on how to present descriptive statistics of bimodal variables in health research.</span>_ Reporting the mean(sd) or median(IQR) of a variable does not clearly communicate that there is more than one peak in a bimodal variable’s distribution. 

When taken alongside the SGBA-5’s assumption that the feminine-masculine continuum doesn’t have a true 0 value, it is our suggestion that:

> _If researchers decide to report a descriptive statistic for a bimodally distributed variable, they should report a nominal description of the variable's distriubtion **skew**._ 

For example, if a gendered aspect of health item from the SGBA-5 demonstrates a bimodal distribution, the variable's **skew** can be described along the feminine-masculine continuum instead of reporting the numerical average alone. 

To be able to describe the **skew** of one of the gender variables, the authors suggest calculating the variable’s mean score along the feminine-masculine continuum and then reporting the skew using the suggested nominal classification guide seen in Table \@ref(tab:02-tab). 

_Please note that these suggested classification guidelines are arbitrary and may not be appropriate in all circumstances._ 


Table: (\#tab:02-tab)Potential Interpretation of Sample Means for Gendered Aspect of Health Items.

|Mean     |Interpretation                 |
|:--------|:------------------------------|
|>70      |"Skews masculine"              |
|55 to 70 |"More masculine than feminine" |
|45 to 55 |"Not strongly skewed"          |
|30 to 45 |"More feminine than masculine" |
|<30      |"Skews feminine"               |

__Note:__
This table assumes you have recorded the gendered aspects of health items as 0 being the most feminine score and 100 being the most masculine score.

For the simulated dataset represented in the density plots above, the mean score for the **gender identity** item was 50.2 and 46.8 for the **gender role** item. This means that when reporting descriptive statistics on the simulated sample we could report that: <span style="color:purple">“*The simulated sample was not strongly skewed on a feminine to masculine continuum for either the gender identity or gender role measures from the SGBA-5*”</span>. 

## Descriptive Table of SGBA-5 Responses

Taking all these together, an example of a sample characteristics table of the SGBA-5 items in the simulated dataset could be presented as has been displayed in Table \@ref(tab:02-tab02)


Table: (\#tab:02-tab02)Simulated sample characteristics.

# SGBA of a Continuous Variable {#continuous}



> *Note: for conciseness, the following examples will only show results for two of the four gendered aspects of health items from the SGBA-5 (gender identity, and gender roles)*


## Biological Sex

A good idea is to start by visualizing the continuous variable’s distribution disaggregated by sex like the density plot in Figure \@ref(fig:04-binary-pos-plot). Then calculate disaggregated summary statistics for the continuous variable disaggregated by sex (Table A4), and conduct a statistical test of difference in means (Welch’s t- test for this example).


### Density Plot

*Interpretation:* From the above density plots (Figure \@ref(fig:04-binary-pos-plot)) we can see a distinct overlap in the *"No interaction example"* with suggests that in that example's sample does not have a meaningful difference in the continuous outcome by sex. Conversely, the *"Interaction example"* density plot has two distinct peaks which suggests that its sample's continuous outcome scores are associated with a participant's sex.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:04-binary-pos-plot)Density Plot of Continuous Variable by Biological Sex Examples</p>
</div>


### Summary Statistics

*Interpretation:* As with the density plots, we see that the standard deviations of the continuous variable for both males and females overlap in the *"No interaction example"* (Table \@ref(tab:03-tab-int)) - indicating a lack of significant difference by sex. The standard deviations of the continuous variable for both males and females do not overlap in the *"Interaction example"* (Table \@ref(tab:03-tab-no-int)) - indicating a potential association between the continuous outcome and sex.
